/*
    In this applet, the user can draw straight lines by clicking and dragging
    and can draw filled rectangles by right-clicking and dragging.  Shift-
    clicking will clear the applet.  The picture is stored in an off-screen
    image, so that the screen can be redrawn as necessary.  A "rubber-band
    cursor" is implemented by drawing the shape the user is sketching
    on top of the stored image.  Since Swing already implements double buffering,
    this applet is, in effect, using triple buffering.
    
    It is assumed that this applet will not change size after it is created.
    The off-screen image is created in the applet's init() method and 
    will not be resized if the applet's size is changed.
