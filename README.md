Finished reviewing the [Chapter 9: Linked Data Structures and Recursion.](http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes5/c9/index.html) I'm getting ready to complete 2 to 3 assignments from this chapter that will be more useful towards the initial stages of my career.

Exercises 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 seem to be the choice for now. The goal is to have them done in a week. 

9.3 is a review of `linked lists` and 9.4 is about a combination of `binary trees and queues` so it will be a good opportunity to make use of both recursive and non-recursive methods in one program. 
> *"Recursive methods are not necessarily better, they are just more efficient and clear when applied to binary trees"*

9.5 is about `Sort Binary Trees` and an interesting statement formulated during this Chapter. If we want a balanced tree we might as well add elements randomly to it, meaning:

- Make Java generate 100 random numbers 
- Add them to the tree using a recursive method
- The algorithm should be able sort all those numbers automatically
- Count the depth or length of the path from the root to any of the leaf nodes
  
A part of me says the answer to the question whether the tree will be balanced is yes, but I don't know why I'm not convinced yet until I see it. 

Something similar happens in my brain when I think about `posfix` and `infix` mathematical expressions. 
>*"Posfix makes more sense to computers, no point competing with them... but at least I'll try once... for now...".*

I uploaded 2 assignments to [b2017/a_Exceptions](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/JavaLearning/tree/master/b2017/a_Exceptions) called Quadtratic and Collatz sequence. 

Because I am programming between Linux and Windows environments, I stopped using the *TextIO.java* classes provided by the course author. These were designed for Windows and were not working with my Codenvy workspace. 
Instead I will implement the Java scanner class and basic input validation.  

**Side notes:**

- I have almost 3 months before starting my C# program at U Washington and I want to cover the most Java topics before then.  
- I have a very detailed list of big topics to cover such as Linked Data Structures, Recursion, Collection Classes, Networking, more GUI programming and basic mobile apps.
