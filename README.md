## JAVA ORIGINS ##

I uploaded 2 assignments to [b2017/a_Exceptions](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/JavaLearning/tree/master/b2017/a_Exceptions) called Quadtratic and Collatz sequence. 

Because I am programming between Linux and Windows environments, I stopped using the *TextIO.java* classes provided by the course author. These were designed for Windows and were not working with my Codenvy workspace. 
Instead I will implement the Java scanner class and basic input validation.  

**Side notes:**

- I have almost 3 months before starting my C# program at U Washington and I want to cover the most Java topics before then.  
- I have a very detailed list of big topics to cover such as Linked Data Structures, Recursion, Collection Classes, Networking, more GUI programming and basic mobile apps.

#### Relevant assignments from 2015 ####

**JumpingSquare.java:** A game where you have to chase a tiny square around the screen. Everytime you click it you earn points but it becomes harder to catch. 

**wordExtractor.java:** *400 width x 200 height*. For a given text, the program displays the number of lines, words and characters used.
>Some of the troubleshooting done here involved reviewing the associative rules of Boolean algebra so I could add several conditionals for the word counter.

**BlackjackGUI.java:** *600 width x 350 height*. The applet implements the 8 winning scenarios and a messaging system that displays the winner for each case. There are a total of 8 winning scenarios: *5 for the dealer and 3 for the player*. 
>I divided the playing field into 2 JPanels, one that contains the game data and another for dealing the cards. These panels refresh independently based on the game progress data. The game continues as long as you have money left.
