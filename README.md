The Exercises [9.3, 9.4 and 9.5](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/JavaLearning/tree/master/b2017/b_StackQueueTree) are now completed. Topics covered include Recursion, Stacks, Queues and Binary Trees

Programs can be run from the *demo* files and every *demo* file contains a sample of the output. Exercises 9.4(TreeQueue) and 9.5(TreeRecursion)** are both included in [TreeQueueDemo.java](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/JavaLearning/blob/master/b2017/b_StackQueueTree/TreeQueueDemo.java) because they share several sort binary tree methods.

- **StackList**.- This program reverses a stack by copying its values to an array
- **TreeQueue**.- Uses a non-recursive method to print a queue of tree nodes ordered by hierarchies. All granparents, then all children and so on.
- **TreeRecursion**.- Calculates the average depth of a binary tree. I achieved this by creating a recursive method that sends the leaf depth to itself. 

It was very useful to work with a graphical representation of a binary tree. This way I was able through witness *"the magic of recursion"* live as it travels to every node. Thanks to [MightyPork](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4965335/how-to-print-binary-tree-diagram) for sharing this method. 

The chapter *"Generic Programming and Collection Classes"*  is next.

Finished reviewing the [Chapter 9: Linked Data Structures and Recursion.](http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes5/c9/index.html) I'm getting ready to complete 2 to 3 assignments from this chapter that will be more useful towards the initial stages of my career.

Exercises 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 seem to be the choice for now. The goal is to have them done in a week. 

9.3 is a review of `linked lists` and 9.4 is about a combination of `binary trees and queues` so it will be a good opportunity to make use of both recursive and non-recursive methods in one program. 
> *"Recursive methods are not necessarily better, they are just more efficient and clear when applied to binary trees"*

9.5 is about `Sort Binary Trees` and an interesting statement formulated during this Chapter. If we want a balanced tree we might as well add elements randomly to it, meaning:

- Make Java generate 100 random numbers 
- Add them to the tree using a recursive method
- The algorithm should be able sort all those numbers automatically
- Count the depth or length of the path from the root to any of the leaf nodes
  
A part of me says the answer to the question whether the tree will be balanced is yes, but I don't know why I'm not convinced yet until I see it. 

Something similar happens in my brain when I think about `posfix` and `infix` mathematical expressions. 
>*"Posfix makes more sense to computers, no point competing with them... but at least I'll try once... for now...".*
