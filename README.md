Done with theory and assignments from Javanotes Chapter 10: [*"Generic Programming and Collection Classes"*](http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes5/c10/index.html)

For this occasion I chose Exercise 10.4, and I also did the first 4 Exercises from Chapter 11: [*"Thinking In Java"*](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~cs476/tijava3R4/textbook/) (plus some of my own fun additions).

The objective was to cover Collections, Predicates, Iterators, Comparators and Views and get a feeling of the compounded potential of Java generic programming.

- Exercise 10.4 includes the files [Person, Predicate and PredGeneric](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/Java/tree/master/b2017/c_ListsSetMaps). The program uses Predicates and Generic Programming to extract specific data from a collection of objects. 

- The second assignment includes the files [Gerbil and GerbilComp](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/Java/tree/master/b2017/c_ListsSetMaps). The program uses iterators, views and my own Comparator method to display HashMaps and organize TreeMaps.

Chapter 11: [*"Files and Networking"*](http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes5/c11/index.html) from Javanotes is next.

The Exercises [9.3, 9.4 and 9.5](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/Java/tree/master/b2017/b_StackQueueTree) are now completed. Topics covered include Recursion, Stacks, Queues and Binary Trees

Programs can be run from the *demo* files and every *demo* file contains a sample of the output. Exercises 9.4(TreeQueue) and 9.5(TreeRecursion)** are both included in [TreeQueueDemo.java](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/Java/blob/master/b2017/b_StackQueueTree/TreeQueueDemo.java) because they share several sort binary tree methods.

- **StackList**.- This program reverses a stack by copying its values to an array
- **TreeQueue**.- Uses a non-recursive method to print a queue of tree nodes ordered by hierarchies. All granparents, then all children and so on.
- **TreeRecursion**.- Calculates the average depth of a binary tree. I achieved this by creating a recursive method that sends the leaf depth to itself. 

It was very useful to work with a graphical representation of a binary tree. This way I was able to witness *"the magic of recursion"* live as it travels through every node. Thanks to [MightyPork](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4965335/how-to-print-binary-tree-diagram) for sharing this method. 

The chapter *"Generic Programming and Collection Classes"*  is next.
