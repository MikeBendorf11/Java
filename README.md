## JAVA ORIGINS ##

	Friday, June 02, 2017 

Chronologically, It's been one year of learning Java in 2015, 1 year of C Programming in 2016 and now I'm back to Java. I implemented some changes in the folder structure:

- I decided to organize again my folders by packages, since I have a lot of small programs with *"main"* classes in them.  
- From now on, classroom and internet learning examples will be collected in the *"Copy"* packages while my programs will be in the *"Mine"* package.
- As I review older files and refresh knowledge, I'll add comments here and there, and I will also continue with the new assignments located in the 2017 folders.

Now it's time to review OOP concepts and continue with chapter 9: *"Exceptions"*, from *Javanotes*.

#### Relevant assignments from 2015 ####

**JumpingSquare.java:** A game where you have to chase a tiny square around the screen. Everytime you click it you earn points but it becomes harder to catch. 

**wordExtractor.java:** *400 width x 200 height*. For a given text, the program displays the number of lines, words and characters used.
>Some of the troubleshooting done here involved reviewing the associative rules of Boolean algebra so I could add several conditionals for the word counter.

**BlackjackGUI.java:** *600 width x 350 height*. The applet implements the 8 winning scenarios and a messaging system that displays the winner for each case. There are a total of 8 winning scenarios: *5 for the dealer and 3 for the player*. 
>I divided the playing field into 2 JPanels, one that contains the game data and another for dealing the cards. These panels refresh independently based on the game progress data. The game continues as long as you have money left.
